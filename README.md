# dulovar

Dulovar is a self-directed academic project exploring modern web and backend technologies:

- Next.js for creating diverse frontends  
- Go (Golang) for internal microservices using gRPC  
- Rust for implementing peer-to-peer components  

The project aims to recreate the concept of Interpol alerts, along with a simplified representation of related entities such as police stations, correctional facilities, and other institutional components.
